Here goes little intro about what tasks are typical when working with GPS/GNSS and a list of available examples (in their own subfolders) connected to such data analysis

| subfolder | task description |
|-----------|------------------|
| `/example_1` |                  |
| `/stuff_1`   |                  |
| `/thing_2`   |                  |

Installation of necessary packages should be described within the subfolders corresponding to given tasks
