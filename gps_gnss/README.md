Here goes little intro about what tasks are typical when working with GPS/GNSS and a list of available examples (in their own subfolders) connected to such data analysis

For working with GNSS data, its typical needed to sort them into groups, it could also be a benifit to merge each GNSS data into a linestring for later computations. in [grouping] scripts for this process could be found.

| subfolder | task description |
|-----------|------------------|
| [grouping](/grouping) | Sort GNSS data into groups and create linestringsZM for each group           |
| `/stuff_1`   |                  |
| `/thing_2`   |                  |

Installation of necessary packages should be described within the subfolders corresponding to given tasks
