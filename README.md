Collection of code examples for classic data processing tasks at Traffic and Transport Section at AAU

_Here goes a description of what the research group works with and some basic navigation to the examples_

| Folder    | Description |
|-----------|------------------|
| [gps_gnss](gps_gnss)  | Set of examples about processing and visualization of GPS/GNSS data |


### TODO
from msa:
- video pre-processing
    - draw and apply transparent mask on image/video (typical pre-processing step for visual analysis)
    - calculate and visualize Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi optical flow in video (tracks of corner features used in some visual analysis applications)
- LIDAR
    - LIDAR data visualization
    - LIDAR coordinates to UTM
- camera calibration
    - Application of TSAI callibration, from T-Callibration to conversion between 3D coordinates to pixel coordinate
- ALPR
    - how to use one of our ALPR pipelines (based on OpenALPR or ALPR-Unconstrained)
